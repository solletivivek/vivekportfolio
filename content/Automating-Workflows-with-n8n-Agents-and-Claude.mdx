Automation is one of the most powerful ways to increase productivity. With **n8n** (a fair-code automation tool) and **Claude** (an AI assistant from Anthropic), you can build custom workflow agents that handle repetitive tasks, respond intelligently to inputs, and integrate with your applications—like your Next.js portfolio project.

In this guide, we'll cover:

- What n8n agents are  
- Why Claude is useful inside n8n  
- How to set up n8n locally with Docker  
- Connecting Claude to n8n using API keys  
- Building a sample automation agent  

---

## What Are n8n Agents?

**Agents** in n8n are workflows that continuously run or get triggered by events. You can connect services like Slack, Notion, Supabase, or databases. Adding **Claude AI** as part of an n8n workflow allows natural language reasoning inside your automations.

Example use cases:
- Summarize customer feedback automatically  
- Generate blog drafts and push them to GitHub  
- Auto-reply to inquiries from your portfolio website  

---

## Why Use Claude with n8n?

Claude brings **contextual understanding** and **reasoning** into workflows. Instead of rigid rules, your automation can "think" about inputs.

Example:  
- Input → "Generate a blog on REST API basics"  
- Claude → Writes a structured draft in Markdown  
- n8n → Publishes it to your `/blog` folder in your Next.js portfolio  

---

## Setting Up n8n Locally

### Install Docker

Make sure Docker is installed and running on your machine.  

```bash
docker --version
```

### Create an `.env` File

In your project root, add:

```bash
DB_TYPE=postgresdb
DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=your-supabase-host
DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=6543
DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=your-username
DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=your-password
DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=your-database
```

### Start n8n with Docker

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  --name n8n \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  --env-file .env \
  docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

Visit: [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678)

## Adding Claude API to n8n

1. Sign up at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com)
2. Generate your **Claude API key**
3. In n8n, go to **Credentials > Add Credential**
4. Select **HTTP Request** → Add your API key in `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`

---

## Building Your First Agent

### Example: Blog Draft Generator for Your Portfolio

1. **Trigger Node** → Webhook (`/blog`)
2. **Claude Node** → Pass the input text (e.g., *"Write a blog about REST APIs"*)
3. **Function Node** → Format the response into `.mdx`
4. **GitHub Node** → Push the file into your `portfolio/blogs/` folder

```json
{
  "name": "Blog Draft Generator",
  "nodes": [
    { "type": "Webhook", "path": "blog" },
    { "type": "Claude", "prompt": "Write blog on {{query}}" },
    { "type": "Function", "code": "format into MDX" },
    { "type": "GitHub", "action": "createFile" }
  ]
}
```

---

## Using in Your Next.js Portfolio

Blogs created by the agent are stored inside `/blogs` as `.mdx`. Your Next.js site automatically picks them up and displays them. You now have an **AI-powered blog system** that runs on autopilot.

---

## Best Practices

**Rate Limits**: Claude has usage limits, add retry logic in n8n.  
**Version Control**: Always commit generated `.mdx` files into GitHub.  
**Security**: Keep API keys in `.env`, never hardcoded.

---

## Conclusion

By combining **n8n agents** with **Claude AI**, you create a powerful automation layer that enhances your Next.js portfolio project. Instead of manually writing and uploading blogs, your AI agent can handle it end-to-end—from drafting to publishing.

This setup not only saves time but also **demonstrates your technical expertise** in automation and AI integration.

---

```bash
# Next Step: Try building a "Portfolio Contact Agent" 
# that reads form submissions and drafts personalized replies with Claude
```

Would you like me to also **create a ready-to-run `.mdx` agent workflow JSON file** that you can import into n8n directly and test this blog system?
