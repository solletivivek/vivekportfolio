Launching a website is an exciting step in establishing your online presence, but it can also be a daunting process, especially if you’re new to web development and hosting. Thankfully, **GitHub Pages** provides an easy and free solution for hosting your website, and you can even use a custom domain to make it more professional.  

In this guide, we’ll walk through the steps to deploy your website on GitHub Pages and manage DNS records for a custom domain.

## ✅ Prerequisites  

Before starting, make sure you have:  

- A **GitHub account** ([sign up here](https://github.com) if you don’t have one).  
- A **GitHub repository** containing your website’s source code.  
- A **custom domain** (from GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.).

   - Push your website source code to the repo.  
   - Ensure the entry file is `index.html`.

## 🌍 Adding a Custom Domain  

1. **Purchase a Domain**  
   - From a registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap).  

2. **Update DNS Records**  
   - Login to your registrar’s DNS management.  
   - Add **A Records** pointing to GitHub’s IPs:  

     | Record Type | Host | Value            |
     | ----------- | ---- | ---------------- |
     | A           | @    | 185.199.108.153 |
     | A           | @    | 185.199.109.153 |
     | A           | @    | 185.199.110.153 |
     | A           | @    | 185.199.111.153 |

   - Add a **CNAME Record**:  
     ```txt
     Host: www  
     Value: yourusername.github.io
     ```

3. **Configure GitHub Repository**  
   - Go to **Settings > Pages > Custom Domain**.  
   - Enter your domain (e.g., `www.svivek.tech`) and save.  

4. **Wait for DNS Propagation**  
   - Changes may take up to **48 hours**.  

5. **Verify Your Domain**  
   - Visit `www.yourdomain.com` to confirm it works.
